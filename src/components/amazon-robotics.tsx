              <p className="mb-4">
                Each robot needs slightly different configurations based on its location, hardware components, and specific role in the facility. Sending complete configurations to each robot would mean transmitting gigabytes of largely redundant data across the network - a massive waste of bandwidth and a potential bottleneck for rapid updates.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The solution was to implement edge configuration assembly - instead of sending complete configurations, we send compact, targeted patch files containing only the key differences. The bulk of the configuration is assembled directly on the robot using these patches and a base template.
              </p>
            </div>

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                <li>Debugging configuration changes across multiple updates was difficult and time-consuming</li>
                <li>Patch files were large and inefficient, containing redundant information</li>
                <li>Network overhead from sending full configurations to each robot was significant</li>

              <h4 className={`${inriaSerif.className} text-xl font-bold mb-3`}>Patch History: Better Debugging Through Visual Diffs</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I implemented a patch history feature that allows developers to track and visualize configuration changes across multiple updates. This made debugging significantly easier by providing a clear view of what changed and when.

                I introduced new patch command types that made configuration updates more powerful and concise. Here's an illustrative example with confidential information removed:

            <p className="mb-4">
              This project exposed me to a scaling problem that only emerges at massive scale. While sending a few megabytes of configuration data to a single robot is manageable, the challenge transforms completely when dealing with millions of robots across different facilities.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The key insight was that linear solutions don't always remain viable at scale. Our edge configuration assembly approach reduced network overhead by over 90% while maintaining the flexibility to customize configurations per robot. More importantly, it's a solution that scales linearly with the number of robots, making it viable for Amazon's growing robot fleet.

              While I thoroughly enjoyed working with my talented team at Amazon Robotics and learned invaluable lessons about scaling systems, I've decided to pursue opportunities elsewhere for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 ml-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Development Velocity:</strong> The approval processes and bureaucratic overhead meant that even small changes could take weeks to implement. Coming from a startup background where I could ship features daily, this pace felt restrictively slow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Limited Innovation Space:</strong> Despite working on interesting technical challenges, the scope for rapid experimentation was constrained by rigid processes and multiple layers of approval.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Startup Appeal:</strong> I'm drawn to the fast-paced, high-impact environment of startups where I can wear multiple hats and see the direct impact of my work immediately. At my current startup, I can move fast, take calculated risks, and learn from quick iterations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cultural Fit:</strong> While I deeply respect Amazon's leadership principles and the incredible people I worked with, I found myself missing the dynamic, experimental culture of smaller companies where decisions can be made and implemented rapidly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              This experience helped me realize that I thrive in environments where I can move quickly, take ownership of entire features, and see immediate impact - characteristics I've found more prevalent in the startup world.
