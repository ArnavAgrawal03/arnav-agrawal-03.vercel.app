                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Early in the project, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of data quality. After feeding raw, unprocessed interview transcripts into an XGBoost model, the results were essentially noise - the model was picking up on irrelevant patterns in formatting inconsistencies and transcription errors rather than meaningful content.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        This led me to develop an automated data cleaning pipeline that handled issues like:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 mb-4">
                        <li>Standardizing text formatting and removing transcription artifacts</li>
                        <li>Resolving inconsistent company and person name references</li>
                        <li>Filtering out boilerplate language and irrelevant sections</li>
                        <li>Handling missing or corrupted data points</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        The improvement in model performance after implementing this pipeline was dramatic, leading to much more reliable signal extraction.

                        This experience taught me that in quantitative finance, the quality of data preprocessing and feature engineering often matters more than model sophistication. Working with the firm's leadership team helped me understand how to translate technical NLP insights into actionable trading strategies.
