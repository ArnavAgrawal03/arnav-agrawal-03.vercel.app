## Editing page content

- Update `content/home.md` to change the hero copy on the landing page. The Markdown supports standard headings, paragraphs, links, and emphasis. Buttons and the profile photo continue to live in code.
- Update `content/archive.md` to change the intro copy on the archive page. The grid of projects and their modal content still live in React components.
- Changes to either file are picked up automatically by `next dev`/`next build`, so you can iterate on the copy without touching TypeScript.
