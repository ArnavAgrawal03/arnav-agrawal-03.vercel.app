## Archive 🗃️

This section contains most of the projects — mostly code and links to my GitHub — that I've worked on. A lot of these projects were collaborations with other really smart people.

Topics include: Algorithmic Game Theory, Theorem Proving, Recommendation Systems, Knowledge Retrieval Systems, Computer Vision, Pacman, and Kaggle Competitions.
